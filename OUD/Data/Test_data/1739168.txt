Report 10th Steering Committee meeting RE -Place 26/10/2020  2 1. Update on the progress of the RE -Place projec t  
 
Although  the COVID -19 pandemic  has limited  the possibilities  to reach  scientists  and to be present  on-
site at the various  organisations , a lot of work  has been  done  to ensure  the progression  of the project . 
 
▪ Identifying experts based on scientific literature  
 
The RE-Place  team  has invested  considerable  time  in review ing the available  scientific  literature  to 
identify  experts  in the field  of NAMs . Although  it can be a tedious  process , this targeted  approach  has 
proven  to be an adequate  way to find the right  experts  and to increase  the chances  to convince  the 
scientists  to submit  their  expertise.  
At present  (28/10/2020),  the RE-Place  database  contain s 149 methodologies  which  have  been  
submitted  by 103 submitters  from  17 different  organisations  (see Figure  1).

▪ Changing  the perception of the RE -Place  project  
 
During  the previous  steering  committee,  concerns  were  expressed  in relation  to the perception  of the 
RE-Place  project  by some  scientists.  Following  that, the scientists  who  expressed  these  concerns  were  
contacted  by the RE-Place  team . Subsequently,  meetings  were  organised  in order  to further  discuss  
and identify  what  could  be done  to address  these  issues.  A lot of constructive  feedback  was received,  
and it was decided  to revise  all communication  and promotional  material  to change  the current  
perception  of the RE-Place  project .  
 
The following  item s have  already  been  modified  based  on the feedback  received  from  the scientists  
and during  the meeting : 
- The project  summary  which  is provide d as an attachment  when  contacting  scientists  via e-mail.  The 
summary  contain s specific  information  about  the importance  of the project  and incentives  for the 

 
Report 10th Steering Committee meeting RE -Place 26/10/2020  3 scientists  to submit  their  NAMs  to the database . This text will be used  as a basis  for the promotional  
material.  Please  review  it carefully  and provide  your  feedback  by Friday  the 13th of November.  
 
- PowerPoint  presentation  for the instruction  video s that were  made  as an online  alternative  to on-
site meetings . These  videos  are recordings  of the presentations  that would  normally  be given  to the 
scientists  on-site consisting  of two parts:  
(i) one introductory  video  providing  information  about  the motivation  and the goal of the RE-Place  
project ; 
(ii) one video  with  practical  instructions  for the researchers  when  complet ing the online  tool.   
Each  part was recorded  in English,  Dutch  and French . Only  for the first part, the content  was 
modified  and new  video s will be recorded . 
 
In addition,  the brochure and flyer  as well as the documents  for the official  communication  from  the 
government  and the introduction  text of the RE-Place  project  on the website  and on the LinkedIn  page  
are being  updated.  
 
As previously  indicated,  the RE-Place  team  is working  on the production  of a promotional  video  for the 
RE-Place  project . In contrast  to the other  videos,  this will be a short  video  of approximately  three  to 
four minutes  that will be made  by professionals  and disseminated  via different  channels  (via e-mail,  via 
LinkedIn,  on the RE-Place  website…). A screenplay  has been  written for the video  which  is planned  to 
be recorded  by the end of the year.  
 
After  seeing  the modifications  that have  been  made  to the promotional  material , the RE-Place  team  
count s on the steering  committee ’s willing ness  to discuss  again  with  their  colleagues  for them  to 
reconsider  their  position  and to encourage  them  to submit  their  expertise  to the RE-Place  database.   
 
▪ Promoting the project through scientific writing  
 
Special  Issue  MethodsX : The Special  Issue  entitled  ‘New  Approach  Methodologies  in toxicology  included  
in the RE-Place  database’  is currently  being  finalised  and will contribute  to the promot ion of the use of 
NAMs  in the field  of toxicology.  Nine  methodologies  from  seven  different  organisations  have  been  
accepte d for the Special  Issue  (i.e. KU Leuven , UGhent, UAntwerp , VUB,  VITO , ULB and Sciensano ). The 
RE-Place  team  also wrote  an editorial  for this Special  Issue  which  will be published  soon : ‘RE-Place  
shows  how  local initiatives  can help  to pave  the road  towards  international  recognition  and promotio n 
of New  Approach  Methodologies’.  A marketing  campaign  has already  been  launched  by Elsevier  to 
promote  this Special  Issue  (accessible  via following  link: https://sci.scientific -
direct.net/view_online.asp?1654956&ea12dbdb66adc386&18 ). 
 
EPAA  Prize : The RE-Place  team  has applied  for the 3Rs Science  Prize  2020 . By doing  that, the project  
can be further  promoted  within  the scientific  community  at the EU level  which  will also further  prove  
its importance  to the scientists  and the progress  of science.  The EPAA  conference  will take  place  on the 
10th of November  2020.  An update  on the outcome  will be provided  to the RE-Place  steering  committee .  
 
Scientific  article  on RE-Place : An article  on the development  of the RE-Place  online  tool and database  
has been  written  and is being  further  modified . By publishing  such  an article , scientists  from  different  
 
Report 10th Steering Committee meeting RE -Place 26/10/2020  4 disciplines  will be informed  on the RE-Place  project  and have  the opportunity  to better  understand  both  
its strengths  and limitations . 
 
 
2. RE-Place survey on users ’ personal experience  
 
After  the completion  of “RE-Place  I”, it was agreed  to do a first evaluation  of the project  and the impact  
of the work  that has been  done  so far. Therefore,  a survey  was conducted  to learn  more  about  users’ 
personal  experience  with  the RE-Place  website,  database  and online  tool.   
The survey  was addressed  to scientists  who  have registered  on the RE-Place  website  and submitted  
information  to the database . In order  to increase  the participation  rate and to receive  more  inpu t, the 
survey  was conducted  anonymously  via Google  forms . However,  it should  be noted  that out of the 177 
registered  people  that were  contacted,  only  29 people  completed  the survey.   
 
▪ Summary of key findings  
 
The survey  consisted  of 14 questions  and overall,  a lot of positive  responses  on the RE-Place  
database/website  were  received.  About  66%  of the participants  indicated  that they  have  used  the 
database  to find information  on NAMs  for a particular  purpose  or more  generally . Some  participants  
were  also looking  to find a contact  for a specific  NAM  or to have  an idea  of the expertise  present  within  
their  institute.  These  answers  are a good  indicator  that the database  is being  used  for the purpose  that 
it was intended  and that it has positive  value  for the scientists . The majority  of the participants  found  
that the RE-Place  online  tool was relatively  easy  to use and that it took  a maximum  of 15 minutes  for 
them  to complete  it. This confirms  that a very  user -friendly  online  tool has been  developed  and that 
the estimated  time  needed  to submit  information  is very  reliable . Moreover , 86%  of the participants  
have  found  the database  very  useful  and would  recommend  it to their  colleagues  and/or  peers.   
 
Although  a lot of positive  feedback  has been  received  from  the participants,  some  areas  for further  
improvement  were  also identified.  
 
- A few participants  signalled  some  issues  with  the search  box and the filters  on the website.  
Additionally,  some  difficulties  were  found  when  navigating  through  the different  steps  of the online  
tool or when  updating  an already  submitted  protocol.  These  issues  will be further  discussed  with  
the development  company  Content  & Coffee .  
 
- Only  14%  of the participants  have  browsed  through  the other  information  available  on the website.  
A possible  reason  might  be the fact that nowadays  people  are less interested  in browsing  websites  
as they  prefer  more  interactive  platforms  such  as social  media,  webinars,  online  training,…  This 
phenomenon  was also indicated  in the JRC report  “Accelerating  progress  in the Replacement,  
Reduction  and Refinement  of animal  testing  through  better  knowledge  sharing” and therefore,  it is 
important  that we also invest  in other  means  of communication .  
 
- One participant  highlighted  that it is important  to ensure  that the information  from  the website  can 
also be found  via Google  Scholar  search . This interesting  comment  will be followed -up by the RE-
Place  team . 
 
Report 10th Steering Committee meeting RE -Place 26/10/2020  5 - Several  issues  that were  encountered  during  the pilot  study,  came  up once  more  in the responses  
as some  people  found  that too much  information  was required  to submit  while  others  expressed  
the need  to have  more  information  on the NAMs . In order  to have  a balance,  it was decided  when  
developing  the online  tool that the people  who  submit  their  expertise  to the database  would  be able 
to add attachments  and give the permission  to be contacted  for more  information . This information  
will be indicated  in the FAQs  page  that will be added  to the website .  
 
- In addition,  it appears  that it is not clear  to all scientist s that the RE-Place  project  also captures  
methodologies  in fundamental  and applied  research  that do not directly  use animals,  even  if their  
results  still have  to be combined  with  animal  experiments  to collect  the information  of interest.  
NAMs  are thus  not necessarily  one-by-one replacement  methodologies,  but can be a single  step  
within  a broader  research  strategy . Furthermore,  scientists  can submit  methods  that are already  
included  in the database,  as this will help  to identify  the expertise  within  an organisation,  and 
provide  more  insights  into one’s  personal  experience  with  the use of NAMs . It will be ensured  that 
this information  is more  visible  to the scientists  in all promotional  and communication  material.  
 
▪ Additional recommendations from the steering committee  
 
The overall  participation  to the survey  was quite  low which  may  be explained  by the fact that many  of 
the people  who  registered  are people  who  participated  to the scientific  seminars  that were  given  last 
year  by the RE-Place  team  at various  organisations.  Some  of the participants  only  registered  to try the 
functionali ties of the website  during  the training , but they  did not have  any method  to submit.  The 
steering  committee  expressed  some  concerns  as such  a low response  could  constitute  a risk that the 
participants  who  replied  are predominantly  positive  about  the projec t and therefore,  the opinions  and 
perspectives  of the people  who  are negative  about  the project  would  remain  unidentified . The survey  
approach  could  be further  adapted,  or additional  steps  could  be taken  to reach  the people  who  are 
more  critical  regarding  the project.  
 
Furthermore,  members  of the steering  committee  indicated  that it would  be interesting  to have  an 
overview  of the different  position s of the participants  (whether  they  are postdoc s, PhD students , group  
leaders,  expert  scientists ). As the survey  was done  anonymously  to ensure  a maximum  response  from  
the people,  it is not possible  to have  this information . However,  an overview  of the different  position s 
of the scientists  who  have  submitted  their  NAMs  to the RE-Place  database  will be made  available.   
 
Considering  the feedback  received  from  the survey,  other  questions  were  raised  by the steering  
committee  regarding  the success  criteria  for the RE-Place  project : 
• Will the survey  be repeated  every  year  to evaluate  users’ satisfaction?   
• Will the survey  be taken  into account  to measure  the success  of the project  or will the RE-Place  
team  only  rely on the number  of methods  included  in the database?   
• Would  it not be possible  to also have  a criterion  that can demonstrate  an increase  in the use of 
NAMs?  
 
The end goal of the project  is to obtain  an increase  in the use of NAMs . Although,  it is a long  process  
and it would  not be easy  to measure , it would  be very  informative  to monitor  the progress  of the project  
towards  that goal.  Therefore,  efforts  should  be made  to identify  intermediate  criteria  to measure  the 
 
Report 10th Steering Committee meeting RE -Place 26/10/2020  6 impact  of the use of the database . A suggestion  was made,  to have  at some  point  a survey addressed  
to the users  of the database  in order  to know  if they  were  able  to reduce  the number  of experimental  
animals  they  used  in their  research  by applying  the NAMs  that are in the database.  In the future,  it 
could  also be interesting  to evaluate  the number  of ethical  committees  in Flanders  and in Brussels  that 
would  require  the researchers  to consult  or use the database.   
 
 
3. Further updates   
 
- Currently,  there  is still a limited  number  of methods  included  in the database,  hence  the focus  will 
be put first on gathering  more  methods  from  the different  organizations.  Once  the database  
contains  enough  methodologies,  funding  agencies  will be contacte d to request  for the RE-Place  
database  to be indicated  in their  research  project  application  forms.  
 
- The FAQs  page  is being  finalised  and will provide  answers  to questions  on the RE-Place  project,  the 
use of the database  and the submission  process  via the online  tool.  The page  will be developed  using  
an accordion  module.  Once  the page  is finalised,  it will be translated  in Dutch  and French  before  
being  integrated  on the website . Moreover,  the remaining  bugs  will be sorted  and the search  box 
as well as its filters  will be further  optimized.  
 
- The effective  creation  of the research  groups  is planned  for next  year . A list of pre-set requirements  
which  are believed  to be useful  for the creation  of research  groups  has been  compile d but further  
conceptualisation  about  the technical  aspects  (e.g.  roles and rights  within  a group,  the level  of 
creation ) is required . A working  group  will be created  to discuss  these  functionalities  and align  them  
more  practically  with  the needs  of researchers.  This will also help  to prioritize  on the most  important  
functionalities  and further  discuss  their  feasibility  with  the development  company.  During  the 
meetin g, Dries  Knapen  volunteered  to join the working  group  and to provide  his advice  on the 
functionalities  that would  be essential . Other  members  of the steering  committee  are still welcome  
to join the working  group.  If you are interested,  please  contact  us before  Friday  the 13th of 
November.  
 
- Some  scientists  are still reluctant  to submit  their  expertise , and it is hoped  that by revising  all 
communication  and promotional  material,  they  will be more  inclined  to contribute  to the database.  
Once  all promotional  materials  are finalised,  it would  be very  much  appreciated  to have  the support  
of the steering  committee  to stimulate  more  participation  from  the scientists  within  their  institute.
